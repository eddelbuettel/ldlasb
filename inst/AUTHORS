Dirk Eddelbuettel wrote the 'ldlasb' package. It is licensed it under
the GNU GPL (>= 2) just like Rcpp itself and many packages using Rcpp.

The package reuses code from the 'cpp11' CRAN package which in its
GitHub repo at https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11 contains an embedded
package 'cpp11test' that is not part of the CRAN releases. It contains
the code used in the 'motivations.Rmd' vignette in the benchmarks
addressed here. Both 'cpp11' and 'cpp11test' are released under the
MIT license.  Currently, authorships for 'cpp11' are, respectively,
Jim Hester and Romain Francois as authors, with Benjamin Kietzman as a
contributors, and RStudio as a copyright holder. The 'cpp11test'
package lists Jim Hester as author and RStudio as a copyright holder.
